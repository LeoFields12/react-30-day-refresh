# React 30-Day Refresh

A 30-day React.js reboot where I rebuild my understanding of components, hooks, state management, and modern best practices — documented daily with code, notes, and small projects.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository documents my commitment to relearn and deepen my React.js skills. Over the next 30 days, I will complete structured lessons, coding exercises, and build small projects to sharpen my frontend fundamentals.

## 🗂️ Structure
- `/notes` — Daily written notes & takeaways  
- `/exercises` — Practice problems and drills  
- `/projects` — Mini-projects for hands-on learning  
- `/challenges` — Extra tasks for mastery  

## 🗓️ Daily Log
Every day I will:
1. Study a targeted React concept  
2. Build at least one exercise or component  
3. Document what I learned  
4. Commit my code & notes
